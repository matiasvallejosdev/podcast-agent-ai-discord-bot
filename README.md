## üìò Introduction

The Podcast Agent Bot is an innovative Discord bot designed to analyze and summarize podcasts. Utilizing OpenAI's powerful GPT and Whisper models, it offers users a seamless way to interact with audio content, providing insights, summaries, and responses to queries based on the podcast's content.

## üéØ Purpose

The creation of the Podcast Agent Bot was inspired by the challenge of consuming and retaining the wealth of information available in podcasts. Often, while listening to podcasts, taking notes and revisiting key points later can be cumbersome. This bot simplifies the process by providing tools to summarize, highlight important information, translate content, and offer an interactive Q&A feature based on the podcast, making the wealth of knowledge in podcasts more accessible and engaging.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Audio Analysis**: Upload your podcast audio files and get a detailed analysis of the content.
- **Transcription**: Convert audio content into text using Whisper for further analysis.
- **Summarization**: Get concise summaries of your podcast episodes, highlighting the key points.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Ask questions about the podcast content and receive accurate answers.
- **Support for Multiple Audio Formats**: Supports mp3, wav, and ogg audio formats.

## üîß Interaction Design & Architecture

Podcast Agent Bot integrates real-time WebSocket communication with Discord's API, allowing users to start conversations, upload audio files, and interact with podcast content seamlessly. It harnesses OpenAI's GPT-4 for intelligent chat completion and uses Whisper for accurate audio transcriptions. The bot's memory system ensures continuity in conversations. Commands like `/upload_audio`, `/clear`, and `/summarize` empower users to fully engage with and analyze their favorite podcasts within Discord. This diagram gives a visual overview of the bot's structure and interaction flow.
